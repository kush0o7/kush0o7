# Hi there, I'm Kushagra Tandon 👋

🎓 **Computer Science Student** @ Arizona State University | Expected Graduation: May 2026

💼 **Passionate about:** Machine Learning, Software Engineering, Data Science

📍 **Location:** Tempe, Arizona

## 🚀 About Me

I’m a Computer Science student at Arizona State University graduating in May 2026, with strong interests in artificial intelligence, full-stack development, and quantitative finance. I have several years of hands-on experience building software across backend systems, web applications, and data-driven models.
My background includes working with languages such as Python, Java, C/C++, JavaScript, and SQL, and frameworks including React, Flask, Django, and TensorFlow. I’ve built projects ranging from scalable web applications to machine learning systems for credit risk modeling and news-driven trading strategies.
Recently, I’ve been focusing on quantitative finance, applying programming, probability, and statistics to financial modeling, algorithmic trading, and risk analysis. I’m particularly interested in roles at the intersection of software engineering, machine learning, and financial decision-making.
I enjoy solving complex problems, learning new technologies quickly, and building systems that create real-world impact. I’m always open to connecting, collaborating on technical projects, or discussing opportunities in software engineering, AI, and quantitative finance.
